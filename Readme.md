* Encode video with large GOP and low FPS.
    * Keyframes take most of the space
    * If I only need video, do I need the container format or is the bitstream enough ? 

* How large will the video be ? 
    * Store a table: duration vs disk size
    * Maybe store a sequence of files
    * Delete some of them
